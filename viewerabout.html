            <h1>About</h1>
            <p span class="phone">Nepal is abundant on agricultural land with two-third Nepalese workers involved in agriculture. However, Nepal imports huge amount of crops from neighbouring countires. One of the contributing factor to this is lack of transparency between the farmers involved in agriculture and the vendors who buy these crops for resale.<br>
             <br>
                Agriculture Information Management System, in short AIMS, was designed and developed in 2022 for this very purpose. It has been built with the core intention of avoiding price disputes between the farmers and the vendors in Nepal, such that the farmers involed in agriculture would be encouraged in their field of work, which in turn would help contribute in Nepal’s GDP.<br>
                <br>
                While the municipality tracks farmer and market prices of each crops, the viewers, on the other hand, can view the latest price of crops based on their municipality.
